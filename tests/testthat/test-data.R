# Work in progress. The book on R packages only mentions examples
# of tests for functions, so make sure to have a look at some test-
# directories of data-focused packages like covdata. Creating tests
# for data is very different from creating tests for functions.

#  expect_equal(str_length("ab"), 2)
#  expect_equal(str_length("abc"), 3)

#  expect_equal(str_length(factor("a")), 1)
#  expect_equal(str_length(factor("ab")), 2)
#  expect_equal(str_length(factor("abc")), 3)
